# MoLib

This is a collection of utility classes developed over the past few years that we'd like to keep re-using in future
robot projects.

## Including in your robot project

Add this project as a git submodule

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:momentumfrc/molib.git src/main/java/frc/robot/molib
```
